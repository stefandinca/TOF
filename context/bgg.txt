  1. BGG Enrichment Script (scripts/enrich-from-bgg.js)                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  A Node.js script that:
  - Searches BoardGameGeek for each game in your library
  - Fetches detailed information including images, descriptions, ratings, and metadata
  - Updates your Firestore database with enriched data
  - Respects BGG's rate limits (5 seconds between requests)
  - Includes comprehensive error handling and progress tracking

  2. Test Script (scripts/test-bgg-api.js)

  A standalone test to verify your BGG API connection works before running the full enrichment.

  3. Detailed Documentation (scripts/README.md)

  Complete guide covering:
  - BGG API registration process
  - Firebase Admin SDK setup
  - Script usage and command-line options
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Best practices

  4. Updated Configuration

  - Added BGG API dependencies to package.json
  - Updated .env.example with BGG API token configuration
  - Added npm scripts for easy execution

  Important: BGG API Registration Required

  BoardGameGeek recently changed their API to require authentication (they call it the "XML APIcalypse"). Before you can use the script, you need to:

  1. Register for API access at https://boardgamegeek.com/applications
  2. Fill in your application details:
    - Name: "Twist of Fate Board Game Library"
    - Description: "Internal tool to enrich game library with BGG data"
    - Redirect URL: http://localhost
  3. Wait for approval (usually quick)
  4. Generate an API token from your application page
  5. Add the token to your .env file as BGG_API_TOKEN

  You'll also need to add your Firebase Admin SDK credentials to the .env file (see scripts/README.md for details).

  Next Steps

  1. Install dependencies (already done):
  npm install
  2. Register for BGG API access (see above)
  3. Configure your .env file with:
    - BGG_API_TOKEN - from BGG
    - FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT - from Firebase Console
  4. Test the connection:
  npm run test-bgg
  5. Run the enrichment (start with a small batch):
  npm run enrich-games -- --limit 5
  6. Enrich all games:
  npm run enrich-games

  The full enrichment for ~180 games will take approximately 30 minutes due to rate limiting.
