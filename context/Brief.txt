Twist of Fate
Board Game Library & Inventory System
Aka Board Game Menu
Design & Implementation Brief

1. Project Overview
Twist of Fate requires a Board Game Library system that serves two distinct audiences:
Customers (Public-Facing UI)
Browse the in-store board game library to discover games available to play or purchase.
Staff (Internal UI)
Manage inventory quantities, add and maintain games, and track inventory changes with accountability.
This system will integrate into the Twist of Fate website and should feel like a modern board game café discovery experience, not a traditional inventory database.
The desired baseline experience is similar to:
https://app.questcentral.ca/games
with specific enhancements outlined below.

2. Core Goals
Fast, intuitive browsing for customers
Simple, low-friction inventory management for staff
Clear distinction between Library and Retail availability
Manual control over metadata (auto-scraping override if possible)
Architected to support future POS / Shopify integration

3. Scope & Phasing
Phase 1 (Required for Launch)
Public Board Game Library browsing experience
Help us find a boardgame tool
Staff inventory management UI
Spreadsheet-driven data model
Inventory audit logging
Explicitly Out of Scope (Phase 1)
Game reservations
Table checkout / “in use” tracking
Customer accounts
Member-only filters
Barcode scanning
Per-copy condition tracking

4. Data Source & Structure
The system will be built from a Board Game Library spreadsheet, which serves as:
Initial data import to Firebase
Ongoing admin reference (not real-time once live)
Ability to Export live library to spreadsheet for historical tracking
Each game record includes (not exhaustive):
Game Title
Game ID (Internal)
Quantity Library (used to compute/tag library availability)
Quantity Retail (used to compute/tag retail availability)
Publisher
Description
Min / Max Players
Min / Max Playtime
Minimum Age
Inventory Category (Base Game or Expansion)
Game Mode (Multi Select)
Description
User Rating (This can be pulled from Boardgame geek)
Genre (Multi-select)
Complexity (This can be pulled from Boardgame geek “Weight” rating
Vibe (Multi Select)
Theme (multi-select)
Game Mechanics (Multi-select)
Tags (multi-select)
Notes
Image URL (Better to have our own image library? Or scrape from Boargame geek)?
Rules URL (We are thinking we can scan in user manuals but not sure where they would be stored)
Multi-select fields are represented as selectable chips in the UI.

5. Customer UI / UX Requirements (Public)
UX Principles
The experience should feel:
Fast (instant feedback, no reloads)
Inviting (encourages exploration)
Low-friction (minimal cognitive load)
Clean with subtle brand flair
Mobile-first design is required.

Search (Top Priority)
A single, prominent search bar must:
Update results in real time as the user types
Require no “Search” or “Apply” button
Search should match against:
Title
Publisher
Category / Genre
Theme
Mechanics
Tags
Partial and fuzzy matches should be supported.

Filters
Filters apply instantly and stack cumulatively.
Core filters:
Player Count (min/max)
Playtime (min/max)
Age
Category / Genre
Mechanics
Theme
Tags
Availability toggles (highly visible):
✅ Available in Library
🛒 Available for Purchase
Active filters should appear as removable chips.

Game Card Design (Grid View)
Each game card includes:
Cover image (primary visual anchor)
Game title
Metadata row (players, time, age)
Availability badges:
Library
Retail
Cards should be fully clickable with subtle tap/hover feedback.
If a game exists in both library and retail, both badges must display.

Sorting
Lightweight sorting controls:
Alphabetical (A–Z / Z–A)
Player count
Playtime
Complexity (if present)

Game Detail Page
Includes:
Large cover image
Title + availability badges
Icon-based metadata rows
Description
Mechanics / Themes / Tags (as chips)
Optional links:
Rules PDF
How-to-Play video
Navigation should preserve filters and scroll position.

Empty States
If no results match:
Friendly message
Suggest clearing or adjusting filters
Never show a blank screen

5A. “What Should We Play?” View (Customer UI)
Purpose
Provide a guided, menu-style discovery experience for customers who may feel overwhelmed by filters or unfamiliar with board games.
This view should feel similar to ordering from a café menu:
Approachable
Conversational
Fast
Confidence-building
This should be visually fun and potentially have some animation/Imagery 

Entry Point
Accessible from the main Board Game Library page via a clearly labeled button or tab
 Example:


“What Should We Play?”


This feature should be optional and not required to browse the full library



Menu Prompt Structure
The What Should We Play? tool presents a small set of plain-language prompts that guide customers to appropriate games.
Inputs should update results in real time and should not require a submit button.

Prompt 1: Group Dynamics
“We are a group of…” “our youngest player is … years old”
Numeric input or stepper
Supports a practical range (e.g., 2–10+ players)
Supports a practical Age range (eg 3-99)
Filters out any games that dont support group size or minimum age requirements



Prompt 2: Experience Level
“Our board game experience is…”
Selectable options:
Beginner
Intermediate
Advanced
Enthusiast


These selections should map internally to the game’s Complexity / Weight value in the dataset.
Example - Beginner should be in the 0-2 range, Intermediate 0-3, Advanced 0-4 and Enthusiast 0-5

Prompt 3: Time Available
“We want to play for…”
Numeric input in minutes
 or


Preset selectable ranges:


Up to 30 minutes
30–45 minutes
45–60 minutes
60+ minutes


This value should filter against Min / Max Playtime fields.

Prompt 4: Game Style Preference
“We want something…”
Selectable options:
Co-operative
Competitive
Social


This should map to Game Mode.

Prompt 5: Vibe Selection
“Our vibe is…”
Multi-select list of Vibe tags
Tags must be sourced directly from the dataset (not hard-coded)


Examples (illustrative only):
Party
Thinky
Strategic
Silly
Fast-paced
Narrative
Cozy
Chaotic


Note: “Vibe” will exist as a dedicated category in the Board Game Library spreadsheet.

Results Behavior
Results display using the same game cards as the main library view


Results update instantly as inputs change


Users may:


Adjust inputs without restarting
Clear individual selections
Exit back to the full library view at any time



Design & UX Expectations
The experience should feel:


Friendly
Non-intimidating
Lightly playful (without being gimmicky)


Avoid long forms or multi-step wizards
Target completion time: under 30 seconds

Explicit Non-Goals (Phase 1)
No saving of preferences
No personalization
No customer accounts
No recommendations outside the existing library



Instruction to Designer
Treat the What Should We Play? tool as a first-time customer helper that reduces decision fatigue and makes choosing a game feel easy and fun.

6. Staff UI (Internal)
Design Direction
Utility-first
Table-based views
Optimized for speed and clarity
Branding optional / minimal

Core Capabilities
Staff can:
Add new games
Remove Games
Edit metadata
Adjust:
Quantity Library
Quantity Retail

Inventory Adjustment Flow
When quantities are changed manually:
Staff must select a reason code:
Sold (manual) -Would like this to be tied into shopify/POS if possible in the future
Damaged
Missing
New Purchase
Adjustment / Audit
Optional notes field

Audit Log (Required)
Every inventory change must record:
Game ID
Field changed
Old value → New value
Reason code
Staff user
Timestamp
Audit logs must be viewable per-game and globally.

7. Future Considerations (Not Required Now)
POS integration (auto-decrement retail inventory)
Shopify sync
Barcode scanning
Per-copy condition tracking
The system should be architected so these can be added later without refactoring the core data model.

9. Final Instruction to Designer
When in doubt, default to:
fewer clicks, instant feedback, and visible state changes.
If a feature is ambiguous, clarity and usability take precedence over complexity.
